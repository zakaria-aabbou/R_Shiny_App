# R_Shiny_App

R shiny Project with univariate and bivariate data analysis using the healthcare-dataset-stroke-data datasets, 
where we predict if a patient is going to have a stroke or not based on multiple variables in the data,
We trained the model and saved it and we generated a link and loaded it into my shiny web app.

You can check the app here : <a href="https://zakaria-aabbou.shinyapps.io/strock_prediction/"> LINK !</a>
